            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>PROPOSALS</hi> Easie, Practicable, and Agreeable to the State of the Nation, for a <hi>New Coynage,</hi> and Repairing the Loss in our <hi>Clipp'd</hi> and <hi>Bad Money,</hi> without putting any stop to Commerce.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposal</hi> 1. THAT the <hi>Old Clipp'd Money</hi> that is Good, be Exchang'd, Tale for Tale, without respect to Weight, as fast as <hi>New</hi> can be Coined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposal</hi> 2. That all the <hi>Bad Money,</hi> at a very short Warning, be brought in, upon the publick Credit, into an Office or Offices for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and Counted, and the Complement thereof (to prevent the Increase) given in to the Parliament now sitting, to be made good to the Owners, by the Publick, when convenient, which will prevent the Ruin of Thousands, and make the whole Nation easie, the same being melted down, and new Coin'd into small Money at leisure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposal</hi> 3. For the better Conveniency of a <hi>New Coinage,</hi> let a sufficient and sure <hi>Fund</hi> be settled by Act of Parliament to incourage the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of useless and superfluous <hi>Silver</hi> (such as <hi>Tankards, Cups, Pots, &amp;c.</hi> in publick Houses) at certain Interest, and at the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Price: which <hi>Silver</hi> being first Coined into <hi>Mill'd Money,</hi> let a <hi>Proclamation</hi> be issued for the Calling so much of the <hi>Old Money</hi> in, as the <hi>New Coin'd</hi> amounts to: Then Coin the <hi>Old</hi> into <hi>New,</hi> and let an equal quantity of the <hi>Remaining Old</hi> be called in, to answer the Product of the <hi>First;</hi> and so do till all be new Minted. By this Method the <hi>Mint</hi> will be immediately set at Work, and the <hi>Running Cash</hi> will not be in the least diminished, during the <hi>New Coinage;</hi> for the <hi>Fund</hi> being appropriated to the making Good the <hi>Plate</hi> to such Persons as bring it in, the <hi>Plate</hi> will supply the Deficiency of the <hi>Clipp'd Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Way, Commerce will be carried on as effectually, as before the Crying down of our</hi> Clipp'd <hi>and</hi> Bad Money, <hi>which is the thing Your Honours, in Your Great Wisdom, are about to provide for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposal</hi> 4. That Three or more <hi>New Mills</hi> be added to the <hi>Tower Mint,</hi> (where there is Conveniency enough for Ten) that the <hi>New Coynage</hi> may be perform'd with greater Expedition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposal</hi> 5. That the <hi>Guinneas</hi> fall gradually, by <hi>One Penny</hi> the first Day of every Month; which will prevent <hi>Stock-Jobbing</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the</hi> New Money, <hi>as fast as Coin'd, were sent into the</hi> Exchequer, <hi>and the</hi> Old, <hi>as it came in, sent to the</hi> Tower <hi>in lieu thereof; all Payments hereafter out of the</hi> Exchequer <hi>to be made in</hi> New Money, <hi>and all Taxes paid in</hi> Old, <hi>the</hi> New Money <hi>would quickly circulate through the Kingdom, and the Countrey be no more drain'd of its</hi> Cash <hi>than as the King's Taxes do it gradually; and this way, 'tis thought, all the</hi> Old Money <hi>in the Countrey will come to the</hi> Mint <hi>in less than Two Years, without any Trouble or Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Tax <hi>might be levy'd by way of <hi>Poll,</hi> which would be sufficient for the Service of the Year</hi> 1696. <hi>for Supplying the Deficiency in our</hi> Clipp'd Money, <hi>and for other Occasions, without fear of having the Supplies to make good the next Year; and yet every Man save more in bare House-keeping in a Year</hi> (<hi>the</hi> Tax <hi>being taken off <hi>Land,</hi> which raises all Provisions above a sixth part</hi>) <hi>than he need be Taxed for his <hi>Head.</hi>
